# Question: What should I do if I end up on my own fork because of a network issue or having an old version of the wallet?

## Procedure
For Windows GUI or CLI users.
1.  Stop the wallet/mining process by cleanly shutting down the program.
2.  Follow the procedure in [HOW-TO Backup, Install or Update and Bootstrap your wallet.md](#!how-to/how-to_bootstrap.md) to efficiently rectify the problem.
3.  Do not be dismayed if it seems that your mining rewards suddenly seem to come to a halt.  Remember, when you mine to the wrong chain rewards can come in very quickly, but they are worth nothing.
