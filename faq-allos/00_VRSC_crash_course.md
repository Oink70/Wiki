Mining:
VerusCoin can be mined with CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs, solo and in pools. However, the algo is carefully designed for CPUs, and they still substantially outrange GPUs.
ARM can work in general, but might not be very efficient. FPGAs can mine this coin, but don't outperform CPUs by much.

Miners:
Besides solo-mining with Verus Agama wallet, you can use:
ccminer for CPU (recommended) or GPU <https://github.com/monkins1010/ccminer/releases>;
nheqminer <https://github.com/VerusCoin/nheqminer/releases> (for Windows, Linux, and MacOS);
