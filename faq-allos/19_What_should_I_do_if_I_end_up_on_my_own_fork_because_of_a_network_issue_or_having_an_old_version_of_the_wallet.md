Question: What should I do if I end up on my own fork because of a network issue or having an old version of the wallet?

Answer:
For Windows GUI or CLI users.
1.)  Stop the wallet/mining process by cleanly shutting down the program.
2.)  Check "HOW-TO Backup, Install or Update and Bootstrap your wallet.md" on how to efficiently rectify the problem.
3.)  Do not be dismayed if it seems that your mining rewards suddenly seem to come to a halt.  Remember, when you mine to the wrong chain rewards can come in very quickly, but they are worth nothing.
